1. CREATE ENVIRONMENT
    * specific python version
    conda create -n djangoenv python=3.6 anaconda    
    
    * latest python
    According to the documentation for conda install,(https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html) 
    conda will (when no version is specified, it seems) try to install the latest version of the specified package(s).

    Hence, you should be able to get the latest version of python in your new environment by running a command like this.
    conda create --name=<myEnvNameHere> python


2. ACTIVATE THE NEW ENVIRONMENT
    conda activate djangoenv

3. INSTALL DJANGO IN THE NEW ENVIRONMENT
    conda install -c anaconda django 
    
    or better use pip:
    python -m pip install django

4. STARTING A DJANGO PROJECT 
    * with activated environment
    django-admin startproject my-project-name

5. Move into the project directory
    cd my-project-name

6. Run the development server
    python manage.py runserver

! Do NOT USE the Django development server in PRODUCTION !
